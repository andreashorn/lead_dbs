function [x,y,z,avgr] = psphere(n,rad)
% [x,y,z,r] = psphere(N)
%
% Distributes N points "equally" about a unit sphere.
%
% N The number of points to distribute
% x,y,z Each is 1 x N vector
% r The smallest linear distance between two neighboring
% points. If the function is run several times for the
% same N, r should not change by more than the convergence
% criteria, which is +-0.01 on a unit sphere.
%
%
% Distributes N points about a unit sphere so that the straight line
% distance between neighboring points is roughly the same. The
% actual criteria for stopping is slightly different. The difference
% between a given point and every other point is stored in a matrix.
% The iterations stop once the maximum difference between any element
% in successive distance matrices is less than 0.01. An absolute
% criteria was chosen due to self-distances being 0, and programming
% around this for relative convergence seemed too much work for too
% little reward.
%
% The algorithm first generates N random points. Then a repulsive
% force vector, based on 1/r^2, is calculated for each point due to
% all of the other points. The resultant force vector for each point
% is normalized, and then each point is displaced a distance S = 1
% in the direction of the force. Any value of S between 0.0 and 1.
% 0 seems to work with most values between 0.2 and 1 taking an average
% of 20 to 30 iterations to converge. If S is too high, too much
% "energy" is being added to the system and it won't converge. If S is
% too low, the points won't be evenly distributed even though the
% convergence criteria is met. Generally speaking, the larger N is
% the larger S can be without causing instabilities. After
% displacement, the point is projected back down onto the unit sphere.
% When the system nears convergence, the displacement vector for a
% given point is nearly in the same direction as the radius vector for
% that point due to the points being equally distributed. A good check
% to make sure the code is working is to specify N = 4 and then check
% that the resulting points form a regular tetrahedron (or whatever
% it's called). How you would do this I don't know (check angles
% maybe). That's why I supplied the demo option so you could look at
% it in progress.
